I am a doctoral candidate in the [Communications, Signal Processing, Networking Lab](https://cosine.clarkson.edu/), advised by [Prof. Mahesh Banavar](https://webspace.clarkson.edu/~mbanavar/wordpress/) amd working closely with [Prof. Jie Sun](https://people.clarkson.edu/~sunj/About.html) and [Prof. Stephanie Schuckers](https://www.clarkson.edu/people/stephanie-schuckers). My research focus is to design and develop algorithms to solve problems in fields related to the Internet of Things (IoT), bio-medical engineering, geo-hazards, and biometrics. My work has resulted in papers and presentations at conferences and symposium (see resume for details).
