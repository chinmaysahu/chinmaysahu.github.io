I am a doctoral candidate in the [Communications, Signal Processing, Networking Lab](https://cosine.clarkson.edu/), advised by [Prof. Mahesh Banavar](https://webspace.clarkson.edu/~mbanavar/wordpress/). I use fMRI to study individual differences in brain activity and connectivity and how these relate to behavior. Specifically, I am investigating how naturalistic task paradigms may be used to draw out individual variation of interest, in both healthy people and those with or at risk for psychiatric illness.

I completed my PhD in neuroscience at Yale University in 2017. My thesis work demonstrated that each individual has a functional connectivity ‘fingerprint’ that is both unique and reliable across various brain states, and that features of these signatures predict high-level cognitive traits such as fluid intelligence.

In July 2020, I will join the faculty at [Dartmouth College](https://dartmouth.edu) as an assistant professor in the [Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences](https://pbs.dartmouth.edu). I will have positions available at all levels, including lab manager, PhD student, and postdoc. If you are interested in studying individual differences under naturalistic conditions using innovative imaging, behavioral and computational techniques, please get in touch!
