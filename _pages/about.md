I am a doctoral candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering, Clarkson University. Currently, I am working in [Communications, Signal Processing, Networking Lab (CoSiNe Lab)](https://cosine.clarkson.edu/), advised by
[Prof. Mahesh Banavar](https://webspace.clarkson.edu/~mbanavar/wordpress/) and working closely with [Prof. Jie Sun](https://sites.google.com/view/jiesun/home) and [Prof. Stephanie Schuckers](https://www.clarkson.edu/people/stephanie-schuckers). 
My research focus is to design and develop algorithms to solve problems in fields related to the Internet of Things (IoT), bio-medical engineering, geo-hazards, and biometrics. My work has resulted in papers and presentations at conferences and symposium (see resume for details).
