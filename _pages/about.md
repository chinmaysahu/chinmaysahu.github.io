I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Section on Functional Imaging Methods](https://fim.nimh.nih.gov) (PI: Peter Bandettini), part of the Laboratory of Brain and Cognition at the National Institute of Mental Health. I use fMRI to study individual differences in brain activity and connectivity and how these relate to behavior. Specifically, I am investigating how naturalistic task paradigms may be used to draw out individual variation of interest, in both healthy people and those with or at risk for psychiatric illness.

I completed my PhD in neuroscience at Yale University in 2017. My thesis work (advisor: Todd Constable) demonstrated that each individual has a functional connectivity ‘signature’ that is both unique and reliable across various brain states, and that features of these signatures predict high-level cognitive traits such as fluid intelligence.
